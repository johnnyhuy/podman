# Podman

This repository provides a collection of sample images to help you build Podman containers. Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers on your Linux System. 

## Testing

The following testing methods are available:

- Podman in Podman: This method allows you to run Podman inside a Podman container, which is useful for testing and development purposes.
- Docker CLI emulation: This method allows you to emulate the Docker CLI, which is useful if you are already familiar with Docker and want to use Podman instead.

## Getting Started

To get started with Podman, you can follow the steps below:

1. Install Podman on your Linux system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the sample images you want to use.
4. Build the image using the `podman build` command.
5. Run the container using the `podman run` command.
